On one side it has most commonly used French words & on the other side it shows their respective translation in English.
The card will automatically flip to its English translation in 3 seconds.
Then you have to press one of the two buttons:
- **_A check button_** 
- **_A cross button_**

What does _green check button_ do?
==========================
When you press the green check button it signifies you already know that word, & it will remove that word from original data so it won't be shown to you again when you try to learn other words.
This will also modify the orginal data and will create a new one in data folder with removed words, so that it syncs up with your progress through learning.

_Red cross button_ on the other hand
----------------------------------
Means you don't know that word and its translation, so it will keep that word and its translation till you don't click check button that is you don't learn that word and its translation.
